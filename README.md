Hello world!

### W2
The reason why RGB are floats instead on integers is because in this project the colors were on a scale of 0 to 1, meaning we needed decimals. If it was 0 to 255 we would have used ints.

The bounce variable is an int as we cannt count half or a fraction of a bounce. A bounce is a bounce so it must increment everytime it bounces.

When simply uncommenting the code for part 4, Unity gave the error of 'expected ;.' This is because the line did not have a ; in the base code.

### W3

The parameters of this function would be an integer from 0 to 100, representing sanity level. Since all this function does is update the brightness level, this would be a void function, returning nothing.
